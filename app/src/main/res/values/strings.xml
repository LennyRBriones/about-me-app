    <string name="bio">Hi, my name is Lenny
        \n \nI love the Carnita Asada, a typical food where I from
        \nsomething else that I like but is not food are the video games, I play a lot of them
        being The Legend Of Zelda franchise one of the most important for me.
        \n \nI also like the crowded cities instead of beach or woods, of course not all the
        crowded cities, examples of that kind of cities could be Tokyo, Amsterdam, Rotterdam,
        Mexico City, Brussels, Utrecht, etc. being Amsterdam my favorite city at this moment.
        \n\nAnother fact about me that maybe you already realize is that I love travel, I´m not
        rich or something like that, I usually go to 2 or 3 short trips by year and 1 long trip every 2 years
        is something that I really enjoy a lot.
        \n\nSomething to finalize my introduction could be that I don´t like any kind of sports.</string>
